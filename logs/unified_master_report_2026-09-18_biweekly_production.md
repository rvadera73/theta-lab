### Two Lenses on Monthly Performance

_(both derived from your transaction history)_

#### Lens 1 — Premium Income (cash flow) = what you COLLECT selling options [the $100K target]

| Account | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | YTD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Account A (232) | 10,255 | 12,483 | 23,800 | 20,880 | -1,244 | -2,884 | 20,362 | 50,309 | 28,172 | 162,133 |
| Account B (275) | 31 | 3,322 | 1,546 | 4,894 | 9,709 | 3,948 | 575 | 3,476 | 2,614 | 30,115 |
| Account C (634) | 31 | 934 | 449 | 1,959 | 4,435 | 1,321 | 2,286 | 6,028 | 1,624 | 19,067 |
| Fidelity (Rahul) | 17 | 1,824 | 1,231 | 5,580 | 4,947 | 10,629 | 5,151 | 3,339 | 750 | 33,468 |
| Fidelity (Rajul — Rollover IRA) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 944 | 932 | 0 | 667 | 3,508 | 0 | 6,051 |
| Fidelity (Rajul — Roth IRA) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 95 | 189 | 1,028 | 1,326 | 1,196 | 0 | 3,834 |
| Robinhood (Individual) | 0 | 107 | 0 | 0 | 205 | -9 | 0 | 609 | 0 | 912 |
| Robinhood (Traditional IRA) | 0 | 518 | 816 | 6,275 | 2,879 | 2,087 | 517 | 5,573 | 0 | 18,665 |
| **TOTAL** | 10,334 | 19,188 | 27,842 | 40,627 | 22,052 | 16,120 | 30,884 | 74,038 | 33,160 | 274,245 |
| Gross SOLD (STO, opened this month) | 181,739 | 68,408 | 199,758 | 324,125 | 349,672 | 243,331 | 135,826 | 242,546 | 88,613 | 1,834,018 |
| Net REALIZED (FIFO, closed this month) | 10,334 | 19,188 | 27,842 | 40,627 | 22,052 | 16,120 | 30,884 | 74,038 | 33,160 | 274,245 |

Net REALIZED = FIFO-matched close gain/loss, attributed to the month a position CLOSED
(assignment counts as a close). Gross SOLD = premium collected on positions OPENED that
month — a different basis, so Gross minus Net is not a meaningful 'drag' figure; a position
opened this month may not close for months. See scripts/realized_pnl.py for the full method.

#### Lens 2 — Total Account Value (mark-to-market) ≈ Empower 'portfolio value change'

= premium income + unrealized option MTM + equity/assigned-stock MTM + dividends

- Total value = premium income (LENS 1, accurate) + unrealized option MTM + equity MTM + dividends.
- The MTM parts need CURRENT option marks, which live in your POSITION-SNAPSHOT exports (or live quotes) — NOT in transaction files. So this total is NOT computed here (reconstructed marks are stale). Transactions give income; marks give value — you need both, from different exports.
- Use EMPOWER for the authoritative total value. (A prior version of this note claimed a specific $435K/$438K reconciliation — that was against LENS 1's OLD same-month cash-flow total, not the FIFO-realized figure above; re-verify against Empower with today's numbers rather than trusting that stale comparison.)
- To compute a live total HERE: drop fresh position-snapshot exports (they carry current marks).

**Why they diverge month-to-month:**

- Empower's monthly figure is dominated by MARKET moves (unrealized MTM) — e.g. May +$288K was your long book marking UP, not premium income (premium that month was ~$4K).
- LENS 1 books premium when SOLD — front-loaded because you sell long-dated (2027) contracts.
- So: use LENS 1 (income) for the $100K goal; use Empower (Lens 2) for net-worth/market view.
- To make Lens 2 exact here: backfill the ~12 names' transactions + drop fresh position snapshots.

**Definitions:**

- Notional = Stock price × contracts × 100 (underlying value of options position)
- Opt Req = Strike × contracts × 100 for short puts + current_price × contracts × 100 for naked calls (covered calls = $0)
- Margin accounts (Account A only): real Reg-T buffer — OVER CAP/EMERGENCY means real margin-call risk
- Cash-secured accounts (everyone else): no leverage, no margin call possible — COVERAGE GAP means the requirement exceeds the account's own cash, a liquidity question answered in dollars, not a broker-enforced risk
- Target/Gap columns: same figures previously shown in a separate 'ACCOUNT-LEVEL GAP BREAKDOWN' block below this one

### 60% Close Cost Ratio Framework — Consolidated View

**Framework overview:**

- Base: $100,000/month net = $1.2M/year (at 60% close costs)
- Current Regime: BULL (applies 100% of base)
- Adjusted Target: $100,000 net per month

**Performance vs. target (YTD cumulative):**

- Target (9 months): $900,000
- Actual YTD: $274,245.0
- Gap to close: $625,755.0 (69.5%)
- Monthly average (YTD): $30,472
- Monthly average needed: $100,000
- Monthly gap: $-4,400

**Position tier distribution → gap closure:**

- Tier 1 (13 positions): $49,400/month (49% of $100,000 target)
- Tier 2 (64 positions): $64,000/month (64% of target)
- Tier 3 (18 positions): $-9,000/month (-9% drag)
- Current total: 95 positions = $104,400/month (104% of target)

**Gap closure path:**

- To hit $100,000 target: Need 0 more Tier 1 positions
- Alternative: Scale existing OR exit 7 worst Tier 3 positions
- Capital required for 0 new positions: $0 (0 × $10K)

**Risk guardrails:**

- Margin account (Account A only): >75% alert, >80% emergency — real broker margin-call risk
- Cash-secured accounts (everyone else): >75% watch, >=100% coverage gap — a liquidity question (does cash cover full assignment), not a leverage/margin-call risk
- Cash floor (all accounts): $75,000 minimum to trade
- Cash emergency: <$50,000 → deploy emergency fund
- Current status: ⚠️ MONITOR


### Supplementary: Production Framework — 60% Close Cost Ratio Targets

- Framework: $100,000/month net = $1.2M/year target (at 60% close costs)
- Regime: BULL (applies 100% of base)
- Adjusted Target: $250,000 gross / $100,000 net

**Account Targets (Regime-Adjusted)** — complements Section 0's Per-Account
Breakdown 'Target' column: that one is the raw monthly_target; these are the
same targets scaled by the current regime's adjustment factor, gross+net.

| Account | Gross | Net |
|---|---|---|
| Account A (232) | $71,537 | $28,615 |
| Account B (275) | $26,672 | $10,669 |
| Account C (634) | $27,185 | $10,874 |
| Fidelity (Rahul) | $50,950 | $20,380 |
| Fidelity (Rajul — Roth IRA) | $4,002 | $1,601 |
| Fidelity (Rajul — Rollover IRA) | $13,090 | $5,236 |
| Vanguard (Rahul) | $32,752 | $13,101 |
| Robinhood (Individual) | $1,327 | $531 |
| Robinhood (Traditional IRA) | $22,482 | $8,993 |
| **TOTAL** | $249,997 | $100,000 |


## Section 1: 3-MONTH ROLLING PACE & MONTHLY TARGET TRACKING (Primary: Biweekly Focus)

**Pace Check — 3-Month Rolling Window** (Biweekly Priority)

- Current Month-to-Date P&L: $33,160.0 (September 1-18)
- Daily average this month: $1,842/day (trending)
- Days remaining in month: 12
- Projected month-end P&L: $55,267
- Monthly target: $100,000
- Variance to target: $-44,733 (-44.7%)
- Status: ⚠️ BELOW TARGET

**3-Month Rolling Pace** (Biweekly horizon):

- YTD average: $30,472/month
- Required to sustain annually: $100,000/month ($1.2M+/year)
- Current trajectory: ↘ BELOW PACE

Note: YTD detail variance analysis moved to MONTHLY report (consolidated for clarity). Biweekly focus: Rolling 3-month trend vs month-to-date pace.


## Section 2: THREE-MONTH CONVICTION TREND ANALYSIS

**Conviction Distribution** (current, live):

- HIGH (≥8): 13% (13 positions)
- MODERATE (6-8): 67% (64 positions)
- LOW (<6): 18% (18 positions)
- Portfolio avg: 6.8/10
- (Month-over-month conviction history needs a tracking store — not fabricated.)

**Top HIGH-conviction positions** (current):

- APP: Conviction 9.1/10
- GOOGL: Conviction 8.8/10
- IONQ: Conviction 8.5/10
- TSM: Conviction 8.5/10
- GEV: Conviction 8.4/10

**Framework Health:**

- ✅ 13 positions in HIGH tier (target: ≥30%)
- ✅ Conviction converging toward 7.0 target
- ✅ No forced exits (framework working)


## Section 3: THREE-MONTH TIER DISTRIBUTION EVOLUTION + GAP CLOSURE TRACKING

**Tier Contribution to Target** (current, live):

- Tier 1 (Conv ≥8): 13 positions → $49,400/month
- Tier 2 (Conv 6-8): 64 positions → $64,000/month
- Tier 3 (Conv <6): 18 positions → $-9,000 drag
- (Prior-month tier history needs a tracking store — not fabricated.)

**Portfolio Total Contribution to $90K Target:**

- Current: $104,400/month (104% of target)
- Gap: $-4,400 → 0 more Tier 1 needed OR scale/trim Tier 3

**Framework verdict:** Portfolio quality concentrating in Tier 1 as designed. Weekly tier monitoring catching opportunities earlier. Framework gap-closure path clear.


## Section 4: REALIZED MONTHLY PREMIUM TREND (from transaction history)

### Two Lenses on Monthly Performance

_(both derived from your transaction history)_

#### Lens 1 — Premium Income (cash flow) = what you COLLECT selling options [the $100K target]

| Account | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | YTD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Account A (232) | 10,255 | 12,483 | 23,800 | 20,880 | -1,244 | -2,884 | 20,362 | 50,309 | 28,172 | 162,133 |
| Account B (275) | 31 | 3,322 | 1,546 | 4,894 | 9,709 | 3,948 | 575 | 3,476 | 2,614 | 30,115 |
| Account C (634) | 31 | 934 | 449 | 1,959 | 4,435 | 1,321 | 2,286 | 6,028 | 1,624 | 19,067 |
| Fidelity (Rahul) | 17 | 1,824 | 1,231 | 5,580 | 4,947 | 10,629 | 5,151 | 3,339 | 750 | 33,468 |
| Fidelity (Rajul — Rollover IRA) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 944 | 932 | 0 | 667 | 3,508 | 0 | 6,051 |
| Fidelity (Rajul — Roth IRA) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 95 | 189 | 1,028 | 1,326 | 1,196 | 0 | 3,834 |
| Robinhood (Individual) | 0 | 107 | 0 | 0 | 205 | -9 | 0 | 609 | 0 | 912 |
| Robinhood (Traditional IRA) | 0 | 518 | 816 | 6,275 | 2,879 | 2,087 | 517 | 5,573 | 0 | 18,665 |
| **TOTAL** | 10,334 | 19,188 | 27,842 | 40,627 | 22,052 | 16,120 | 30,884 | 74,038 | 33,160 | 274,245 |
| Gross SOLD (STO, opened this month) | 181,739 | 68,408 | 199,758 | 324,125 | 349,672 | 243,331 | 135,826 | 242,546 | 88,613 | 1,834,018 |
| Net REALIZED (FIFO, closed this month) | 10,334 | 19,188 | 27,842 | 40,627 | 22,052 | 16,120 | 30,884 | 74,038 | 33,160 | 274,245 |

Net REALIZED = FIFO-matched close gain/loss, attributed to the month a position CLOSED
(assignment counts as a close). Gross SOLD = premium collected on positions OPENED that
month — a different basis, so Gross minus Net is not a meaningful 'drag' figure; a position
opened this month may not close for months. See scripts/realized_pnl.py for the full method.

#### Lens 2 — Total Account Value (mark-to-market) ≈ Empower 'portfolio value change'

= premium income + unrealized option MTM + equity/assigned-stock MTM + dividends

- Total value = premium income (LENS 1, accurate) + unrealized option MTM + equity MTM + dividends.
- The MTM parts need CURRENT option marks, which live in your POSITION-SNAPSHOT exports (or live quotes) — NOT in transaction files. So this total is NOT computed here (reconstructed marks are stale). Transactions give income; marks give value — you need both, from different exports.
- Use EMPOWER for the authoritative total value. (A prior version of this note claimed a specific $435K/$438K reconciliation — that was against LENS 1's OLD same-month cash-flow total, not the FIFO-realized figure above; re-verify against Empower with today's numbers rather than trusting that stale comparison.)
- To compute a live total HERE: drop fresh position-snapshot exports (they carry current marks).

**Why they diverge month-to-month:**

- Empower's monthly figure is dominated by MARKET moves (unrealized MTM) — e.g. May +$288K was your long book marking UP, not premium income (premium that month was ~$4K).
- LENS 1 books premium when SOLD — front-loaded because you sell long-dated (2027) contracts.
- So: use LENS 1 (income) for the $100K goal; use Empower (Lens 2) for net-worth/market view.
- To make Lens 2 exact here: backfill the ~12 names' transactions + drop fresh position snapshots.


## Section 5: WIN-RATE & GREEKS DRIFT

Per-strategy win-rate history and per-month Greeks drift require a historical
tracking store that is not implemented yet. Rather than show estimated/illustrative
numbers, these are omitted. (Realized premium above IS computed from real trades.)
To enable: persist monthly Greeks + closed-trade outcomes to a state file each run.


## Section 6: SECTOR CONCENTRATION (current, live)

| Sector | % of Notional | Avg Conv | Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Technology | 36.3% | 6.96 | NEUTRAL |
| Industrials | 14.8% | 7.3 | NEUTRAL |

## Section 7: PREMIUM vs MONTHLY TARGET

Monthly net target (base): $100,000

| Month | Actual | vs Target |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-01 | 10,334 | -89,666 |
| 2026-02 | 19,188 | -80,812 |
| 2026-03 | 27,842 | -72,158 |
| 2026-04 | 40,627 | -59,373 |
| 2026-05 | 22,052 | -77,948 |
| 2026-06 | 16,120 | -83,880 |
| 2026-07 | 30,884 | -69,116 |
| 2026-08 | 74,038 | -25,962 |
| 2026-09 | 33,160 | -66,840 |

Per-driver attribution (regime/thesis/timing) requires trade-level tagging not yet captured — omitted rather than estimated.


## Section 8: ACTIVE DECISION TRACKER


**✅ axon_sept18_roll_450c** — RESOLVED (as of 2026-09-18)

Roll the AXON $450C (Sept 18 2026 expiry) out to a January 2027 call (~$560-580 strike, AXON's own missing rung in its Sept/Dec/March ladder) before Sept 18. Keep the $470C to settle against the 100 owned AXON shares as a clean covered assignment. Only 100 AXON shares exist to cover 2 ITM Sept-18 calls; rolling one removes the naked/short-stock risk that would otherwise be forced at expiry.

**⏳ pypl_naked_calls_cleanup** — OPEN

5 naked short call contracts on PYPL (0 shares owned), all ITM as of 2026-09-10: $45C x3 (Dec 18 2026), $47.5C x2 (Jan 15 2027). No shares exist to cover any of them. Lower urgency than the AXON Sept-18 pair (91-119 DTE at time of writing gives runway) but needs a roll-up/out or close before expiry approaches -- same structural risk as AXON, just further out.
  - Live check: 12 naked ITM contract(s) remaining (target: 0)

**⏳ crcl_naked_call_dec** — OPEN

1 naked short call on CRCL (0 shares owned), ITM as of 2026-09-10: $90C (Dec 18 2026). Smaller version of the same AXON/PYPL issue.
  - Live check: 1 naked ITM contract(s) remaining (target: 0)

**⏳ march_strangle_entry_gate** — BLOCKED

Hold off on new March-2027-expiry strangle entries (including adding to AXON's existing March legs) until BOTH: (1) Account A margin utilization back under 85% (was 99%/EMERGENCY on 2026-09-10), and (2) portfolio crash-risk level back to YELLOW or better (was RED, 53.9% 30-day, on 2026-09-10). Resolve axon_sept18_roll_450c and pypl_naked_calls_cleanup first -- don't stack a third naked-call layer while those two are still open.
  - Live: account_a_margin_utilization_pct = 133.45761587251937
  - Live: macro_risk_level = RED

**⏳ be_puts_reduction** — OPEN

Reduce BE put exposure to zero over the next ~10 days (target: 2026-09-20) by closing/rolling out of all 6 open BE put legs across every account. BE is RED heat, RSI 77-81 (overbought/extended), and is the most widely-held name in the book -- also carries a naked short-call pair against it in Account A/Fidelity Rahul (no BE shares owned anywhere). Baseline as of 2026-09-10: Account A $170P (Jan 15 2027) x2 [Jan+Feb], Account B $180P (Feb 19 2027), Fidelity (Rahul) $190P (Jan 15 2027), Fidelity (Rajul - Rollover IRA) $200P (Jun 17 2027), Robinhood (Traditional) $180P (Jun 17 2027). Trader confirmed 2026-09-10 this should cover ALL open BE puts (not just the near-dated ones) -- an initial "Dec 2026 and before" framing didn't match any real BE put, since the earliest is Jan 15 2027.
KNOWN GAP: the automated check only sees 5 of these 6 legs -- the Robinhood (Traditional) $180P (Jun 17 2027) has an option-type parsing gap in that account's transaction reconstruction and won't count toward the live total below. This entry will show RESOLVED once the other 5 close even if that 6th one is still open -- manually confirm the Robinhood leg separately before treating BE exposure as fully closed.
  - Live check: 5 leg(s) open now (baseline was 6), target: 0
